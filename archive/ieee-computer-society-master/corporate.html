We're always pleased to develop new relationships with our electrical engineering counterparts in the professional world. For information about ways your company can work with the IEEECS at UT, please refer to our <a href="/files/IEEECS-Corporate-Packet-Fall-2017-Spring-2018.pdf">Corporate Packet</a>.
